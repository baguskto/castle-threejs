# Castle Three.js Viewer

A 3D castle viewer created with Blender and Three.js.

## Overview

This project showcases a 3D castle model created in Blender and displayed on a web page using Three.js. The castle is inspired by a low-poly medieval castle design.

## Features

- Interactive 3D castle model
- Orbit controls for camera movement
- Toggle rotation of the castle
- Reset camera view
- Responsive design
